# Pacific Liberty
Pacific Liberty is a text-based adventure game that takes players on a journey back in time to the period of the Bataan Death March during World War II. The game follows the story of a young man who discovers an entryway to the past in his ancestor's old house, transporting him to an entirely new world in the 1940s.

Utilizing Statesman, a platform that enables the creation of modern text adventure games, Pacific Liberty offers an immersive and interactive experience for players. Inspired by early computer games like "Zork," Pacific Liberty combines entertainment and educational value, emphasizing the "edutainment" aspect of gaming.

In the game, players must help the young man survive the harsh conditions of war by using their wits to navigate through the challenges and obstacles of the Bataan Death March. The American forces, led by Sgt. Miller, hold a clipboard bearing the names of the Filipino troops who will fight alongside the Americans to stop the Japanese army. Players must make strategic decisions and work together with Sgt. Miller and the troops to survive and ultimately achieve Pacific Liberty.
