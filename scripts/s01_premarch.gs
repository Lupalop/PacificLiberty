        01_pme_l0|A young man discovered an entryway to the past in their ancestor's old house.%nIt's as if he has entered into an entirely new world, back in the 1940s, with %npeople looming in the background and the streets bustling with life. There was %na crowd forming around the capitol building. %n%nSgt. Miller, a man of the American forces, is holding a clipboard bearing the %nnames of the Filipino troops who will fight alongside the Americans to stop the %nJapanese army.
        01_pme_l1|A lot of soldiers are boarding the ship to Bataan, while %nSgt. Miller is still examining the clipboard with the list of names. %n%nPerhaps you should board the ship too.
        01_pme_l2|You look up the sky and saw there were aircrafts flying fast in the %nclear and humid sky of Pampanga. Many people were shouting how annoying the %nUS Navy is for showing off their flying formation. However, one look at it and %nyou will know which country it truly belonged to. %n%n"It's the Japs! Run for shelter! Bombs!"
        01_pme_l3|You saw a huge rock coming your way, should you jump over?
